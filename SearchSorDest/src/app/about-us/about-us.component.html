                    <h3 class="my-sm-3 my-2">The Airline Management System is a comprehensive online platform where
                        customers can book flights, manage their
                        bookings, and access a wide range of services with ease. Through a web browser, customers can
                        search for flights by
                        destination, date, and airline, add them to their itinerary, and complete the booking process
                        using secure payment
                        methods. Users can log in with their account details, or new customers can quickly create an
                        account by providing their
                        name, contact information, and travel preferences.

                        To access the Airline Management System, customers need only a computer or mobile device with an
                        internet connection.
                        After logging in, they can explore available flights, check their booking status, and make
                        payments using credit cards,
                        debit cards, or online banking options. If a booking has not yet been confirmed, customers may
                        cancel or modify it. The
                        system ensures prompt communication with airlines to manage any changes or cancellations
                        efficiently.

                        In addition to booking flights, the platform offers features such as seat selection, meal
                        preferences, and baggage
                        options, allowing customers to personalize their travel experience. Refunds for canceled
                        bookings will be processed and
                        credited back to the customer's original payment method, whether it's a credit or debit card.
